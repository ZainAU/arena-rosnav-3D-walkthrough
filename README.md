# Arena-Rosnav-3D
This repository is the 3D version of the navigation platform [arena-rosnav-2D](https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-rosnav). It is build on the 3D ROS simulator Gazebo and integrates with a modified Pedsim Simulator to provide realistic dynamic 3D scenarios and tasks to evaluate and and benchmark classic and learning-based ROS navigation approaches on multiple robot platforms. It is fully compatible with the planning algorithms trained and developed with [arena-rosnav-2D](https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-rosnav). This presents an essential step in deploying the navigation approaches from arena-rosnav towards real robots.

| *Random task mode* | *Arena Generated* |

The repo currently contains:
- Local planners for dynamic obstacle avoidance: `teb`, `dwa`, `mpc`, `cadrl (DRL)`, `rlca(DRL)`, `arena (DRL)`, `rosnav (DRL)`
- Task generator with modes: `random`, `scenario`, `manual`, `staged`
- Multiple detailed scenario-worlds
- Robot models: `turtlebot3_burger`, `ridgeback`, `jackal`, `agv-ota`, `Robotino(rto)`, `youbot`, `turtlebot3_waffle_pi`, `Car-O-Bot4 (cob4)`, `dingo`
- [Automated] Creation of random 3D-words with static and dynamic obstacles
- Realistic behavior patterns and semantic states of dynamic obstacles (by including pedsim's extended social force model, extended with industrial classes)
- Implementation of intermediate planner classes to combine local DRL planner with global map-based planners: `Spatial Horizon`, `Space-Time`, `Subsampling`
- Integration with [arena-tools](https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-tools) map generator and [LIRS-World_Construction_Tool](https://gitlab.com/LIRS_Projects/LIRS-WCT). Providing seamless conversion from randomly generated ROS maps to actual Gazebo worlds.
- "Random world" task mode, where with each Task reset, a new Gazebo world is loaded

Please refer to [Installation.md](docs/Installation.md) for detailed explanations about the installation process.

> ***NOTE***: This repo is using **ros-noetic** and **python 3.8**




## 2. Usage
<!-- The gui should currently not be used since it is not updated to include multi-robot support -->

<!-- For a finer user experience we provide a Python GUI, please have a look at [GUI.md](docs/GUI.md) for more information.

Arena-rosnav-3D is structurally very similar to [arena-rosnav](https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-rosnav) to allow easy switching between 2D and 3D environments. Currently, a large number of custom worlds and a random world generator are supported. You can include dynamic obstacles either in a *scenario* mode or in a *random* mode where the dynamic obstacle trajectories are determined randomly.

#### Worlds
We provide the following worlds:

| *hospital* | *experiment_rooms* | *bookstore* | *turtlebot3_world* |


#### World generation with arena-tools and LIRS
By combining the random 2d map generation feature from our own **arena-tools** with the seamless image to Gazebo world conversion of **LIRS_World_Construction_Tools** we can test our navigation approaches on magnitude of 3D worlds, varying in layout, complexity.
For more information on how to use this feature please refer to [arena-tools](https://github.com/Jacenty00/arena-tools). Otherwise, if you already have your own map image in mind, visit [LIRS_World_Construction_Tools](https://gitlab.com/LIRS_Projects/LIRS-WCT) to gain information on how to convert it into a Gazebo world.

#### Robots
We support different robots:

```

### Training

To quick start drl training run the following lines. For more detailed information see [this](docs/DRL-Training.md) documentation.
```bash
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_gazebo.launch  train_mode:=true use_viz:=true  task_mode:=random
